rem   1. Double-click this file -> interactive prompt. Paste a link or a path.
rem   2. Drag .gguf files onto this file -> checks them right away.
rem
rem This file is intentionally ASCII-only. cmd.exe parses .cmd files using the
rem active console code page, so UTF-8 Chinese here would be garbled before any
rem "chcp" took effect. All Chinese output comes from check.mjs instead.
rem
rem No "chcp 65001" on purpose: Node writes to a Windows console via
rem WriteConsoleW, which is code-page independent. Forcing the code page only
rem corrupts piped output (every line gains a stray character).
rem
rem Interactive input is read in "cooked" mode on Windows (see inputMode() in
rem check.mjs). Raw mode would clear ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE and break Ctrl+V /
rem right-click paste in this window - that was the "cannot paste anything" bug.

rem Node is the runtime, this file is only a launcher - without Node there is
rem nothing to run. Say that up front, with the exact command to fix it, instead
rem of failing later on a confusing error. ASCII only, see the note at the top.
